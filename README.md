<h1>Hi, I'm Anjie!</h1>

âœ¨Welcome to my little corner of the internet âœ¨

<p>I'm a former retail professional turned Front-End DevOps.</p>

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on converting a static site to a responsive one using Flexbox. Check out my repo as I go: https://github.com/Anjie-MF/unplugged
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how my former career in retail benefits my budding tech career. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjiemay23/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: One of the unforgettable moments thus far was meeting the legendary director John Waters, during
                which he signed a book authored by my style icon, Dita Von Teese.<
