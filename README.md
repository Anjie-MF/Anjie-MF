# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi there! I'm Anjelica, a passionate front-end developer with a background in retail. Currently, I'm completing the Skillcrush Front-End boot camp, expected to finish in May 2025, where I'm on track to learn React, React Hooks, and Ruby.<br><br>🔍My technical toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub. I'm proficient in responsive web design and leverage Chrome Dev Tools for efficient debugging. My retail experience has equipped me with strong problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability skills, which I now apply to front-end development.<br><br>🛠 In my previous career, I increased customer satisfaction by 20% through improved customer service training. I also achieved 95% compliance with merchandising standards, leading to a 15% boost in sales. My ability to hyperfocus allows me to dive deep into complex coding challenges and deliver high-quality results.<br><br>🚀 I'm excited about contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with dynamic teams. Let's connect and explore how we can build amazing things together!<br><br>🌟 Fun fact: With my ADHD, I have to implement strategic planning and action orientation to manage conflicts with ease. I'm constantly learning and adapting, making me a resilient and resourceful team player.<br><br>Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub.
