# üí´ About Me:

üëãHi! I'm Anjelica, currently the Freight Flow Lead at my store‚Äîa role that's all about being the go-to person for moving products efficiently from the backroom to the sales floor and making sure everything looks great. As the captain of both the backroom and store presentation, I lead a team, plan and organize shipments, keep displays neat and compliant, and support management with key tasks. I am coaching my teammates, setting a positive example, and making sure everyone feels respected and included.

While I thrive in retail leadership, I'm also passionate about technology and am currently enrolled in the Skillcrush bootcamp, learning to become a Front-End Developer. My skills include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I love blending creativity and logic in my projects. Some of my favorite coding projects are:

- [Your Handy Neighbor](https://github.com/Anjie-MF/Your-Handy_Neighbor)
- [Testimonials Grid](https://github.com/Anjie-MF/FEM_testimonialsGrids_figmaChallenge)

What motivates me about coding is being at the forefront of the next wave of tech‚Äîespecially the AI revolution. For a long time, I thought tech was just for the "Sheldon Coopers" of the world, but now I know it's truly for everyone. I love the blend of creative and analytical thinking in front-end development. My current technical toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, & GitHub. I'm proficient in responsive web design and leverage Chrome Dev Tools for efficient debugging.  Debugging can be tough, but nothing beats the satisfaction of seeing a beautiful page finally render after a long night!üåü Fun fact: With my ADHD, my ability to hyperfocus allows me to dive deep into complex coding challenges and deliver high-quality results.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me bellydancing, practicing archery, or raving with my best girl.
